        Risk of Rain 2 is a game that was published in the year 2020 for most platforms currently available such as windows, mac, xbox etc.  
        Risk of Rain 2 was a game created within the game engine Unity3D and Mono which is an open source implementation of the .NET framework and C#.  
        Mono allows for the game to be moddified using a mono injector which is a special way of injecting a dll into a game that uses this framework so that the dll is able to call 
        Unity Engine 3D specific functions without having to use techniques like hooking which is a common technique for more modern Unity Engine 3D games with the introduction of il2cpp. 
        il2cpp (Intermediate language to c++) is a more modern framework that has been introduced that converts the .NET mono code (the intermediate language) into c++ (cpp) so it is easier to run on an assortment of different platforms without much modification.
        <br />
        <br />
        This internal cheat uses the Mono injector method that was mentioned earlier to inject the dll into RoR2 and manipulate what is happening.
