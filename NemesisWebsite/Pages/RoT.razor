        Risk of Rain 2 is a game that was published in the year 2020 for most platforms currently available such as windows, mac, xbox etc.
        Risk of Rain 2 was a game created within the game engine Unity3D and Mono which is an open source implementation of the .NET framework and C#.
        Mono allows for the game to be moddified using a mono injector which is a special way of injecting a dll into a game that uses this framework so that the dll is able to call
        Unity Engine 3D specific functions without having to use techniques like hooking which is a common technique for more modern Unity Engine 3D games with the introduction of il2cpp.
        il2cpp (Intermediate language to c++) is a more modern framework that has been introduced that converts the .NET mono code (the intermediate language) into c++ (cpp) so it is easier to run on an assortment of different platforms without much modification.
        <br />
        <br />
        This internal cheat uses the Mono injector method that was mentioned earlier to inject the dll into RoR2 and manipulate what is happening.  The MonoInjector is included within the zip file
        that can be downloaded from a click of the button above for user convenience!  If you need additional help in running there is also a supplied installation guide below and a readme file!
