    <MudText Typo="Typo.h1"> 0x90 - A game meant to be hacked </MudText>
    <MudDivider DividerType="DividerType.Middle" Class="my-6" />
    <MudText> 0x90 is a portal inspired game that has the player learning game hacking, computer science, reverse engineering, and multiple other fundamentals while solving puzzles.  This project was started at the beginning of 2024 but quickly went on hold
        due to university commitments, development has now been resumed as of 22/06/2024.
        <br /><br />
        0x90 is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) which is a game engine that FNU has not worked with before due to most of my game development experience being within Unity3D.  If interested in some older archived Unity3D projects you can see them <strong>here</strong>.
        Creating 0x90 in UE5 allows for a deeper insight into how the engine works which helps with reverse engineering of other games that use the same engine.  Updates for this game will be posted on this website or on UnknownCheats, the thread can be viewed <strong>here</strong>.

            <MudText Typo="Typo.h4">Update 1 - 06/02/2024</MudText>
            <MudText>
                So Update, I have quickly thrown together a few prototype levels to test a couple level ideas and uploaded a video for how it would work. Keep in mind all blueprints, meshes, style, lighting, 
                literally everything is prototyping at the moment and I have just been messing with some assets to try find a style, so dont worry everything will be redone (so it wont look like shit which is its current state) before an actual demo would be released in the future! There will also be dialogue or a "companion" to help the player through the levels and give them a nudge in the right direction towards solving the puzzles

                I like the idea of solving the puzzles using different tools so I will put in "tutorials" on how to pass each levels with multiple different 3rd party tools, making each level replayable and a have a chance to approach the same problem with a 
                different solution. There will also be a level select screen so players can hone in their skills in the areas they want or need to. These kind of levels with changing a simple variable such as 0 to 1 would be extreme beginner levels that are at 
                the very start aimed at teaching players the very basics of how game hacking and memory modification works.

            <MudText>
                Been working hard on the game in my spare time and as someone pointed out on my last update; the lighting looked like SHIT! So I have been cleaning up the lighting and design of each level and will have an update video soon! Also have some levels prototyped to teach players how to find and use static pointers in game hacking! 
                I find the new lighting and "style" gives a more portal-esk vibe which I like but there is still a lot of design to go and this is no where near how the final product will look.

            <MudText Typo="Typo.h4">Update 3 - 27/02/2024</MudText>
            <MudText>
                Just a quick update on a level concept I put together quickly to introduce the idea of static pointers to the player. Again keep in mind non the the graphics, lighting, audio are permanent as this is a pretty new level and there will also be a in 
                game guide helping the player achieve this (Currently coming up with a way to do this while not putting the player into tutorial hell as well as keeping it fun and contained within the game). Tell me what you think. Also thinking of calling the game "0x90" for now, kinda like it, not sure if it will stay.

            <MudText>
                Working on fleshing out the first 5 levels now with a tutorial component and everything  in the meantime I made a sort of development log of the game to give it more context and the intentions behind it, what I am aiming for, 
                and future development feel free to check it out. Again thanks to everyone giving suggestions and helping with the project, it means a ton. <iframe style="width:350px; height:230px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SuAWnU0gVQQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                Made a second devlog covering all the changes that have been made to the game if anyone is interested in the progress  Ignore the clickbait, it was late at night and me and a mate were messing around and found it funny at the time.

                Finally another update on the game! Thankyou for all the kinda comments and support! I am now working hard on getting the actual structure of the demo down so I can release it in the near future for anyone who is interested to have a play and get an idea of how the game works and if its something they would be interested in playing the full version of! heres the latest devlog. Once again thankyou for all the support. <br/>
